<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*7bnLKsChXq94QjtAiRn40w.png">

I am using iris.csv dataset for the classification.

The algorithm is implemented from scratch without using scikit-learn.

Data Set Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv?resource=download

The problem is comprised of 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species.

Classification is done on features:
1. sepal length
2. sepal width
3. petal length
4. petal width (all in the same unit of centimeters).

The predicted attribute is the species, which is one of Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor or Iris-virginica.
